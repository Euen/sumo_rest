Generic cowboy handlers to work with Sumo D

## Introduction
We, at Inaka, are used to build our RESTful servers on top of [cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy). We use [sumo_db](https://github.com/inaka/sumo_db) to manage our persistence and [trails](https://github.com/inaka/cowboy-trails) together with [cowboy-swagger](https://github.com/inaka/cowboy-swagger) for documentation.

Soon enough, we realized that we were duplicating code everywhere. Not every endpoint in our APIs is just a CRUD for some entity, but there are definitely lots of them in every server. As an example, most of our servers provide something like the following list of endpoints:

* `GET /users` - Returns the list of users
* `POST /users` - Creates a new user
* `PUT /users/:id` or `PATCH /users/:id` - Updates a user
* `DELETE /users/:id` - Deletes a user
* `GET /users/:id` - Retrieves an individual user

To avoid (or at least reduce) such duplication, we started using [mixer](https://github.com/chef/mixer). That way, we can have a *base_handler* in each application where all the common handler logic lives.

Eventually, all applications shared that same *base_handler*, so we decided to abstract that even further. Into its own app: **sumo_rest**.

## Architecture
This project dependency tree is a great way to show the architecture behind it.

As you'll see below, **Sumo Rest** gives you _base handlers_ that you can use on your **Cowboy** server to manage your **Sumo DB** entities easily. You just need to define your routes using **Trails** and provide proper metadata for each of them. In particular, you need to provide the same basic metadata **Swagger** requires. You can manually use the base handlers and call each of their functions when you need them, but you can also use **Mixer** to just _bring_ their functions to your own handlers easily.

## Usage
In a nutshell, **Sumo Rest** provides 2 cowboy rest handlers:

- [`sr_entities_handler`](src/sr_entities_handler.erl) that provides an implementation for
    + `POST /entities` - to create a new entity
    + `GET /entitites` - to retrieve the list of all entities
- [`sr_single_entity_handler`](src/sr_single_entity_handler.erl) that provides implementation for
    + `GET /entity/:id` - to retrieve an entity
    + `PUT /entity/:id` - to update (or create) an entity
    + `PATCH /entity/:id` - to update an entity
    + `DELETE /entity/:id` - to delete an entity

(Of course, the uris for those endpoints will not be exactly those, you have to define what _entities_ you want to manage.)

To use them you first have to define your models, by implementing the behaviours `sumo_doc` (from **Sumo DB**) and [`sumo_rest_doc`](src/sumo_rest_doc.erl).

Then you have to create a module that implements the `trails_handler` behaviour (from **Trails**) and _mix in_ that module all the functions that you need from the provided handlers.

## A Basic Example
You can find a very basic example of the usage of this app in the [tests](tests/sr_test).
Let me walk you through the process of creating such a simple app.

### The application definition
In [sr_test.app](tests/sr_test.app) file you'll find the usual stuff. The only particular pieces are:

* The list of `applications`, which includes `cowboy`, `katana`, `cowboy_swagger` and `sumo_db`.
* The list of `start_phases`. This is not a requirement, but we've found this is a nice way of getting **Sumo DB** up and running before **Cowboy** starts listening:
```erlang
  { start_phases
  , [ {create_schema, []}
    , {start_cowboy_listeners, []}
    ]
  }
```

### The configuration
In [test.config](test/test.config) we added the required configuration for the different apps to work:

#### Swagger
We just defined the minimum required properties:
```erlang
, { cowboy_swagger
  , [ { global_spec
      , #{ swagger => "2.0"
         , info => #{title => "SumoRest Test API"}
         , basePath => ""
         }
      }
    ]
  }
```

#### Mnesia
We've chosen **Mnesia** as our backend, so we just enabled debug on it (not a requirement, but a nice thing to have on development environments):
```erlang
, { mnesia
  , [{debug, true}]
  }
```

#### Sumo DB
**Sumo DB**'s **Mnesia** backend/store is really easy to set up. We will just have 2 models: _elements_ and _sessions_. We will store them both on **Mnesia**:
```erlang
, { sumo_db
  , [ {wpool_opts, [{overrun_warning, 100}]}
    , {log_queries, true}
    , {query_timeout, 30000}
    , {storage_backends, []}
    , {stores, [{sr_store_mnesia, sumo_store_mnesia, [{workers, 10}]}]}
    , { docs
      , [ {sr_elements, sr_store_mnesia}
        , {sr_sessions, sr_store_mnesia}
        ]
      }
    , {events, []}
    ]
  }
```

#### SR Test
Finally we add some extremely na√Øve configuration to our own app. In our case, just a list of users we'll use for authentication purposes (:warning: **Do NOT do this at home, kids** :warning:):
```erlang
, { sr_test
  , [ {users, [{<<"user1">>, <<"pwd1">>}, {<<"user2">>, <<"pwd2">>}]}
    ]
  }
```

### The application module
The next step is to come up with the main application module: [sr_test](test/sr_test/sr_test.erl). The interesting bits are all in the start phases.

#### `create_schema`
For **Sumo DB** to work, we just need to make sure we create the schema. We need to do a little trick to setup **Mnesia** though, because for `create_schema` to properly work, **Mnesia** has to be stopped:
```erlang
start_phase(create_schema, _StartType, []) ->
  _ = application:stop(mnesia),
  Node = node(),
  case mnesia:create_schema([Node]) of
    ok -> ok;
    {error, {Node, {already_exists, Node}}} -> ok
  end,
  {ok, _} = application:ensure_all_started(mnesia),
  sumo:create_schema();
```

#### `start_cowboy_listeners`
Let's go step by step on this one.
Since we're using **Trails**, we can let each module define its own ~~routes~ trails.
